      <h2>The Super Bowl</h2>
      </p> The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL). It has been played every year since the AFL_NFL merger agreement in 1966. The first few years the game was designated as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. It was not until a few years later when the merger finally was completed and the teams were assigned to “conferences”, 1970 NFL Championship Game was played and that the game was called the Super Bowl. The name, originally named by then Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, was coined after several versions of a championship game name never took hold. Hunt used the term Bowl that the collegiate game uses for its end of year contests and combined it with the new toy that his kids were frequently known to enjoy… the Super Ball.
      The first few years the winner of the game was awarded the “World Professional Football Championship” trophy, which in 1970 was renamed the Vince Lombardi Trophy, honoring the head coach of the 2-time champion Green Bay Packers.</>
